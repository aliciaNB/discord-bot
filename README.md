# discord-bot
Welcome! Hopefully, you stumbled upon my repo because you were seeking information about the :robot:s, if not, 
then the :robot:s found you!

##About
This repo is intended to be *both* a personal project for creating a first Discord Bot from scratch using Discord.js and 
Node.js && to be a knowledge base for myself or anyone really who comes across it. I will be adding information I found
helpful along the way.

*Note: Creating a first bot **could** be difficult or rather easy depending on prior knowledge of coding principles...
this is not a beginners guide to programming or really even a guide at all. Just a collection of my notes, what I found 
important, helpful, and/or resources I actually used and stashed for later while tinkering!* 

##Getting Started

###General Resources
I found the official [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) and 
[Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) 
docs to very generous resources for beginners new to Discord Bots. Additionally, this particular community
[discordjs.guide/](https://discordjs.guide/) was invaluable for a clean `Hello World!` version of a bot that is 
self-hosted and ready for exploring all the wondrous possibilities of discord bots further.

Checklist compiled while constructing the hello world project:

* Good IDE with a linter that you can comfortably code, test, and debug JS, JSON, etc. 
* Comfortable with command line coding and Terminal
* Latest version of: 
    - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) 
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
    - [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
* JavaScript, [ES6 Standards](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp), JSON, APIs
 
***Note**: Beyond hello world and self-hosting. You want the bot to run 24/7? Investing in a VPS, server hosting, and/or
db storage is something to look into. [Here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-hosting/)* is the best summary of 
options I found! - It even comes with readable getting started help for each option! Nifty && Concise* :partying_face:
